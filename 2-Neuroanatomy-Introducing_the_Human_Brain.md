# 2. Neuroanatomy: Introducing the Human Brain

## Introduction, Learning Objectives and Recommended Reading

### Introduction

Your introduction to Medical Neuroscience now continues with a brief highlight of some of Prof. White's favorite places in the human brain, followed by tutorials on the cells of the central nervous system (CNS) and some anatomical conventions for finding your way around the human CNS.

This lesson concludes with your first graded quiz. In this quiz and in all other multiple-choice assessments in Medical Neuroscience, please keep in mind that most questions will ask you to identify the single BEST response item, not just a marginally correct choice, but the very BEST choice. So please don’t just think about what’s “right” and “wrong”. Consider which option or options are “best” among those provided. A small number of questions may ask you to “select all that apply”, in which case more than one response option is “best”.

### Learning Objectives

Prof. White's Favorite Places in the Human Brain

- Name one or more of your favorite places in the human brain!

Functional Microanatomy of Neurons

- Differentiate the basic classes of cells found in the central nervous system (CNS).
- Characterize the “functional microanatomy” of neurons (differentiate neuronal cell bodies, dendrites, axons and synapses).
- Describe the microanatomical composition of gray matter and white matter in the CNS.Describe the basic classes of cells found in the central nervous system (CNS).

Non-Neural Cells of the CNS

- Describe the basic functions of the three major types of glial cells found in the CNS.
- Characterize the blood-brain barrier.

Basic Orientation in the Human CNS

- Discuss position in various divisions of the central nervous system (CNS) using the following pairs of direction terms: anterior/posterior; rostral/caudal; superior/inferior; dorsal/ventral; and medial/lateral.
- Demonstrate the three orthogonal planes that are used to section the CNS.

## Video: Non-Neural Cells of the CNS

- the basic classes of cells found in the central nervous system (CNS)
  - Neurons
  - Neuroglia cell = glia
  - Vascular endothelium
- the basic functions of the three types of glial cells found in the CNS.
- the blood-brain barrier.
- Neuroglia cell: supports chemical and electrical functions of neurons
  - supports the metabolic (=chemcial) and signaling (=electrical) functions of neurons
  - participates in neuron circuit formation and synaptic plasticity
  - makes myelin (= axonal insulation)
  - contributes to formation of blood-brain barrier
  - participates in inflammatory response in injured neural tissue, including phagocytosis of cellular debris
  - contributes to the formation of scar tissue in damaged brain and spinal cord
- Glia type 1: **Astrocyte**
  - is found primarily in gray matter (closely associated with neuronal cell bodies, dendrites, and synapses).
  - helps maintain ionic balance of extracellular fluids.
  - takes up and processes neurotransmitters from synaptic clefts.
  - assists in the formation of new synapses and circuits.
  - contributes to the formation of blood-brain barrier and brain-ependymal (ventricular) barrier.
  - contributes to the formation of scars in necrotic neural tissue following injury.
- Glia type 2: **Obligodendrocyte**
  - is found in the white matter.
  - forms myelin (Schwann cells make myelin in peripheral nerves).
    - The myelin aids the propgation of neural signals along myelinated axons.
  - presents antigens that influence the outgrowth of axons in developing and recovering brains.
    - indirectly influences axonal growth.
  - is subject to immunological attack in diseases of the CNS (e.g., multiple sclerosis)
  - inslutes axons by generating layers of membrane that wrap around axon segments.
    - This inslulation decreases ionic "leakiness" of the membrane.
  - forms gaps between myelin segments, called "nodes of Ranvier".
    - The **nodes of Ranvier** allow for the economoical {concentration of ion channels and ion pumps} that are necessary for electrical signaling in axons.
- Glia type 3: **Micoglial cell**
  - is a special type of mononuclear phagocyte that resides in the CNS.
  - is derived from hematopoietic precursor cells that migrate into the brain during development.
  - exists in one of two forms: amoeboid and ramified.
    - The **ramified** form is in the **dormant** state.
    - The **amoeboid** form is the **activated**, **mobile state** when microglia cells are engaged in phagocytic activity.
- Glia type 4: **Glial stem cell**
  - is a subset of astrocytes located near the ventricles, often adjacent to blood vessels.
  - gives rise to more stem cells.
  - matures astrocytes or oligodendrocytes, or mature neurons.
  - exhibits key properties of somatic stem cells:
    - proliferation
    - self-renewal
    - potency to make all the cells of a given tissue
- Glia type 5: **Oligodendrocyte precursor**
  - is scattered throughout the white matter.
  - mainly gives rise to mature oligodendrocytes but may generate astrocytes and neurons.
- **Blood-Brain Barrier**
  - is a specialized permeability barrier between the capillary endothelium and the extracellular space in the neural tissue.
- Q. Consider a person with a stroke that causes a small region of brain damage. Which of the options below happened first?
  - A. Microglia were stimulated to convert from ramified to amoeboid states.
