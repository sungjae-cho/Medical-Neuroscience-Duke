# 6.1. Synaptic Transmission

## Learning Objectives / Recommended Readings

Now that you know the basic mechanisms responsible for generating and propagating electrical impulses in the nervous system, you are ready to learn about what happens when an action potential invades the terminal of one neuron and confronts the small gap between one neuronal process and that arising from another excitable cell. We are speaking, of course, of the "**synapse**".

As always, start your studies by reading through the learning objectives below, and follow along in the tutorial notes (attached to each video) as you view the tutorials. As needed, consult the accompanying reading from the textbook, Neuroscience, 6th Ed., listed below.

So let's get started by reflecting on this lesson's learning objectives.

### Learning Objectives

**Synaptic Transmission** (2 parts)

- Compare and contrast the structural and functional similarities and differences between electrical and chemical synapses.
- Describe the sequence of events responsible for the transmission of a neural impulse from one neuron to the next via a chemical synapse.
- Characterize the critical role of calcium in chemical neurotransmission.
- Discuss the mechanisms of action by which Botox affects neurotransmission.

**Neurotransmitters** (2 parts)

- Name the major small molecule **neurotransmitters** and **neuropeptides** in the CNS and briefly state the function of each.
- Account for the factors that determine the effect of neurotransmitters on postsynaptic neurons.

**Neurotransmitter receptors** (3 parts: Ionotropic neurotransmitter receptors, parts 1 & 2, Metabotropic neurotransmitter receptors and postsynaptic mechanisms)

- Discuss the means by which ligand-gated ion channels affect the membrane potential of postsynaptic neurons.
- Compare and contrast the structure and function of **ligand-gated ion channels** and **metabotropic (G-protein coupled) receptors**.
- Discuss the properties of the **NMDA receptor for glutamate** and why it is important for synaptic plasticity.
- Account for the factors that determine the effect of neurotransmitters on postsynaptic neurons.

**Synaptic integration**

- Discuss the concepts, **"excitatory postsynaptic potential" (EPSP)** and **"inhibitory postsynaptic potential" (IPSP)**, defining them in terms of the reversal potential for the postsynaptic current and the threshold for generating an action potential.
- Describe how postsynaptic potentials can summate in space and time.
