# Neural Signaling

## Video: Overview of Neural Signaling

- Key words: resting (membrane) potential, resting state, depolarization, hyperpolarization, passive response, action potential, spike, active transporter, concentration gradient, ion channel, ion pump
- Electrical signaling is the fundamental process that underlies all aspects of brain function.
- Neurons are instrinsically poor at generating electricity (from the perspective of its insulation)
- Neurons have developed mechanisms to overcome this limitation.
- Electrical signals are transferred upon the flow of ions across the neuronal plasma membrane.
- Stronger current injection -> More spikes

- Keywords: electrochemical equilibrium, the permeability of the neuronal plasma membrane, Nerst equation, concentration gradient, diffusion, electrical gradient
- Neurons communicate using both electrical and chemical signals.
- Concentration gradient: The gradual change in the concentration of a substance within a region. This happens when the concentration of a substance is higher in one area compared to another.
- Diffusion: The phenomenon that particles tend to move from an area of high concentration to an area of low concentration
- Direction of diffusion: High concentration -> Low concentration
- Active transporter: ion pump. This reverses the diffusion to create concentration gradient.
- Electrical gradient: the difference in electric charge (voltage) across a region, such as across a membrane.
- If concentration and electrical gradients have the opposition direction, then they form **electrochemical equilibrium**.
- The causes of electrochemical equilibrium: (1) selective membrane permeability (2) diffusion (3) electrical forces
- Electrochemical equilibrium is formed very quickly with a few ions.
