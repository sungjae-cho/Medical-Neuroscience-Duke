## Video: Overview of Neural Signaling

- Keywords: resting (membrane) potential, resting state, depolarization, hyperpolarization, passive response, action potential, spike, active transporter, concentration gradient, ion channel, ion pump
- Electrical signaling is the fundamental process that underlies all aspects of brain function.
- Neurons are instrinsically poor at generating electricity (from the perspective of its insulation)
- Neurons have developed mechanisms to overcome this limitation.
- Electrical signals are transferred upon the flow of ions across the neuronal plasma membrane.
- Stronger current injection -> More spikes

## Video: Ionic Basis of the Resting Membrane Potential, part 1

- Keywords: electrochemical equilibrium, the permeability of the neuronal plasma membrane, Nerst equation, concentration gradient, diffusion, electrical gradient
- Neurons communicate using both electrical and chemical signals.
- Concentration gradient: The gradual change in the concentration of a substance within a region. This happens when the concentration of a substance is higher in one area compared to another.
- Diffusion: The phenomenon that particles tend to move from an area of high concentration to an area of low concentration
- Direction of diffusion: High concentration -> Low concentration
- Active transporter: ion pump. This reverses the diffusion to create concentration gradient.
- Electrical gradient: the difference in electric charge (voltage) across a region, such as across a membrane.
- If concentration and electrical gradients have the opposition direction, then they form **electrochemical equilibrium**.
- The causes of electrochemical equilibrium: (1) selective membrane permeability (2) diffusion (3) electrical forces
- Electrochemical equilibrium is formed very quickly with a few ions.

## Ionic Basis of the Resting Membrane Potential, part 2

- Keywords: Nernst equation, Goldman equation
- Nernst equation: A mathematical formula that describes the equilibrium potential (also called the Nernst potential) of an ion across a membrane, considering the concentration difference of that ion between the two sides of the membrane.
- Goldman equation / Goldman-Hodgkin-Katz (GHK) voltage equation: The equation used to calculate the resting membrane potential of a cell by considering the contributions of multiple ions with varying permeabilities across the membrane. Unlike the Nernst equation, which applies to a single ion, the Goldman equation accounts for the combined effects of several ions.
- The depolarization potential: $\approx$ the Nernst potential of sodium due to the permeability $P_{Na} \gg P_{K}$
- The resting potential: $\approx$ the Nernst potential of postassium due to the permeability $P_{K} \gg P_{Na}$
- The permeability of cloride $P_{Cl}$ is negligible.
- Membrane permeability and membrane potential interact each other.
- Membrane permeability changes are essential to form action potentials

## Ionic Basis of the Action Potential, part 1

- Keywords: transient inward current, delayed outward current
- The transient inward current reverses near 50mV.
- The delayed outward current steadily increases.

## Ionic Basis of the Action Potential, part 2

- Keywords: conductance, inactivation
- The early current is carried by sodium.
- The late current is carried by potassium.
- Current is a function of conductance and "driving force".
$$I_{ion}=g_{ion}(V_{m}-E_{ion})$$
- Both sodium and potassium conductance are voltage- and time-depedent.
- Sodium conductance becomes inactivated.
- Potassium conductance never becomes inactivated.

## Ionic Basis of the Action Potential, part 3

- Keywords: rising stage, falling stage, inactivation, refractory period, (absolute/relative) refractory period, undershoot, hyperpolarization
- Action potential: Increase in Na+ permeability -> Na+ entry -> Depolarization -> K+ loss repolarization
- Suprathreshold depolarization: Depolarization before K+ outflux
- Subthreshold depolarization: Depolarization after K+ outflux
- Potential increase by Na+: Fast positive cycle
- Potential decrease by K+: Slow negative cycle
- Absolute refractory period:
  - The neuron cannot fire another action potential, no matter how strong the stimulus.
  - This is due to inactivated voltage-gated sodium channels.
- Relative refractory period:
  - The neuron can fire another action potential, but only if the stimulus is stronger than usual.
  - This is because some sodium channels have reset, but the membrane is still hyperpolarized due to the continued outflow of potassium ions (K+).

## Molecular Mechanisms of Action Potential Generation, part 1

- Keywords: (None)
- $\Delta$(Membrane permeability) $\leftrightarrow$ $\Delta V_m$
- The inactivation of Na+ channels happens because of a gating mechanism.
- K+ channels do not have this mechanism. Thus, it does not become inactivated.

## Molecular Mechanisms of Action Potential Generation, part 2

- Keywords: ATPase pump, Na+/K+ pump, Ca2+ pump
- ATPase pumps: Na+/K+ pumps, Ca2+ pumps
- The circular mechanism of Na+/K+ pumps
