# Neural Signaling

## Video: Overview of Neural Signaling

- Key words: resting (membrane) potential, resting state, depolarization, hyperpolarization, passive response, action potential, spike, active transporter, concentration gradient, ion channel, ion pump
- Electrical signaling is the fundamental process that underlies all aspects of brain function.
- Neurons are instrinsically poor at generating electricity (from the perspective of its insulation)
- Neurons have developed mechanisms to overcome this limitation.
- Electrical signals are transferred upon the flow of ions across the neuronal plasma membrane.
- Stronger current injection -> More spikes
