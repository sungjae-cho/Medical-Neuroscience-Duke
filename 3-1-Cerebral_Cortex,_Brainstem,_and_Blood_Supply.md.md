# 2.1. Cerebral Cortex, Brainstem, and Blood Supply

## Learning Objectives

Lateral Surface of the Cerebral Hemispheres

* Demonstrate the four paired lobes of the cerebral cortex and describe the boundaries of each.
* Sketch or craft using common objects the major features of each cerebral lobe, as seen from the lateral view, identifying major gyri and sulci that characterize each lobe.

Medial Surface of the Cerebral Hemispheres

* Demonstrate the four paired lobes of the cerebral cortex and describe the boundaries of each.
* Sketch or craft using common objects the major features of each cerebral lobe, as seen from the medial view, identifying major gyri and sulci that characterize each lobe.

Finding the Central Sulcus

* Recognize the central sulcus from its medial terminus in the paracentral lobule to its lateral terminus in the lateral fissure.
* Sketch the central sulcus in the cerebral hemisphere and label the segments of the pre- and post-central gyri that represent somatic motor control and somatic sensation for the contralateral leg, arm and face.

Ventral Surface of the Cerebral Hemisphere

* Describe the major features of the cerebral lobes, as seen from the ventral view, discussing major gyri and sulci that characterize each lobe.
* Recognize the major embryological subdivisions of the brain that are visible from the ventral view.

Building a Digital Brain (Fingers to Gyri)

* Demonstrate using your fingers (in air or on a surrogate model of a human brain) the major gyri and sulci of each lobe within the cerebral hemisphere.

Surface Anatomy of the Brainstem

* Identify the the basic embryological subdivisions of the human brainstem: midbrain; pons (and cerebellum); medulla oblongata.
* Indentify the 12 cranial nerves and describe their attachments to the human brain.

Blood Supply to the Brain

* Identify the major blood vessels that comprise the anterior and posterior circulation of the brain.
* Discuss the source of blood to the anterior and posterior circulation.
* Sketch the anastomotic ring of blood vessels (the circle of Willis) at the base of the brain.
* Identify the major blood vessels that supply the spinal cord.
* Describe the system of vessels for venous drainage of blood from the brain into the jugular veins.

## Video: Lateral Surface of the Brain

- central sulcus
- superior frontal gyrus
- middle frontal gyrus
- inferior frontal gyrus
- posstcentral gyrus
- inferior parietal lobule
- superior parietal lobule
- intraparietal sulcus
- parieto-occipital sulcus
- pre-occipital notch
- superior/middle/inferior temporal gyri

## Video: Medial Surface of the Brain

- Skipped. It is not meaningful to write down all names.
- Forebrain, midbrain.

## Video: Finding the Central Sulcus

- Sensory and motor gyri are close together.
- (Why do the locations of bodily sense and action exist in simlar locations for different people?)

## Video: Ventral Surface of the Brain

- (The function of cortex may be determined by the type of arriving sensory signals)

## Video: Building a Digital Brain (Fingers to Gyri)

- (The distribution of the function across the brain may give me intuition to understand the principles of brain organization.)

## Let's Discuss: Is Bigger Better?

What do you think?  Is brain like muscle?  Is a bigger brain better than a smaller brain?  What about for subregions, such as a particular area within the cerebral cortex; do you think that size scales with performance?

Please share your thoughts, reflections, insights, research, etc., that you may be inspired to consider by this long-standing question in the brain sciences.

**My answer**

The size of the brain matters, but not always. On the first hand, the size matters across species as human brains are greater relative to their body size. In addition, brains that went through developmental problems may have smaller size. On the other hand, among normal adults, the brain size does not give significant benefit to perform better.

## Surface Anatomy of the Brainstem

- Brain Stem, Midbrain, Pons, Medulla Oblongata, Cerebral Peduncles, Medullary Pyramids, Corticospinal Tract, Olive, Cranial Nerves, Ventral Surface.

## Blood Supply to the Brain

- blood supply, brain, internal carotid arteries, vertebral arteries, anterior circulation, posterior circulation, basilar artery, cerebral arteries, venous drainage, dura mater, superior sagittal sinus, anterior cerebral artery, middle cerebral artery
- (After seeing the complexity of bloody suppy in the brain, I got to think that sleep might be for recovery of the brain rather that of the body.)
