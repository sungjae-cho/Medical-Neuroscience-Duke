# 6.2. Synaptic Plasticity

## Learning Objectives / Recommended Readings

Arguably, the single theme in modern neuroscience that will have the largest impact on society and the future of medicine is **neural plasticity**. It will be well worth your time to bear down and patiently consume the video tutorials, associated notes, and the textbook readings that discuss the synaptic mechanisms that wire and re-wire the brain. Increasingly, an understanding of the principles of neural plasticity are shaping interventions for neurological diagnoses as diverse as autism spectrum disorders, traumatic cerebrospinal injury, and stroke.  Moreover, the general public (many of you, I know!) are increasingly demanding evidence-based practices for promoting wellness and advances in human performance across the lifespan that are based on principles of neural plasticity. So get ready for this "brave new world" where neuroscience will very likely become a foundational scientific discipline for healthcare professionals and public educators/advocates alike!

So how can we possibly do justice to this important topic?  Well, we can't.  But in this lesson, we will make an effort to cover the basic principles of synaptic plasticity. In Week 10, we will return to this theme of neural plasticity as we learn about brain development in early postnatal life, and the means by which the brain can change (learn) across the lifespan.

So let's get started by reading through and reflecting on this lesson's learning objectives.

### Learning Objectives

**Long-term potentiation** and **depression** (3 parts)
- Characterize general cellular mechanisms for synaptic change.
- Characterize **long-term potentiation (LTP)**.
- Discuss the role of **AMPA** and **NMDA** subtypes of **glutamate receptors** in the induction and maintenance of LTP.
- Characterize **long-term depression (LTD)**.
- Discuss the molecular basis of LTD in the cerebral cortex and cerebellar cortex.

**Spike-timing dependent synaptic plasticity**
- Characterize general cellular mechanisms for synaptic change.
- Discuss the importance of the timing of the **postsynaptic response**, relative to **presynaptic activity**, for synaptic plasticity.

**Hebb's postulate**
- Characterize general cellular mechanisms for synaptic change.
- State Hebb's postulate and discuss its relevance for neural plasticity.
