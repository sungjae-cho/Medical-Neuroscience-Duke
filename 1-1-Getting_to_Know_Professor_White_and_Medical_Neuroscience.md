## Video: The Scope of Medical Neuroscience

### **Core concepts** in the field of neuroscience
1. The brain is the body's most complex organ.
2. Neurons communicate using both electrical and chemical signals.
3. Genetically determined circuits are the foundation of the nervous system.
4. Life experiences change the nervous system.
5. Intelligence arises as the brain reasons, plans, and solve problems.
6. The brain makes it possible to communicate knowledge through language.
7. The human brain endows us with a natural curiosity to understand how the world works.
8. Fundamental discoveries promote healthy living and treatment of disease.
