# 1-2 Neuroanatomy: Introducing the Human Brain

## Introduction, Learning Objectives and Recommended Reading

### Introduction

Your introduction to Medical Neuroscience now continues with a brief highlight of some of Prof. White's favorite places in the human brain, followed by tutorials on the cells of the central nervous system (CNS) and some anatomical conventions for finding your way around the human CNS.

This lesson concludes with your first graded quiz. In this quiz and in all other multiple-choice assessments in Medical Neuroscience, please keep in mind that most questions will ask you to identify the single BEST response item, not just a marginally correct choice, but the very BEST choice. So please don’t just think about what’s “right” and “wrong”. Consider which option or options are “best” among those provided. A small number of questions may ask you to “select all that apply”, in which case more than one response option is “best”.

### Learning Objectives

Prof. White's Favorite Places in the Human Brain
- Name one or more of your favorite places in the human brain!

Functional Microanatomy of Neurons
- Differentiate the basic classes of cells found in the central nervous system (CNS).
- Characterize the “functional microanatomy” of neurons (differentiate neuronal cell bodies, dendrites, axons and synapses).
- Describe the microanatomical composition of gray matter and white matter in the CNS.Describe the basic classes of cells found in the central nervous system (CNS).

Non-Neural Cells of the CNS
- Describe the basic functions of the three major types of glial cells found in the CNS.
- Characterize the blood-brain barrier.

Basic Orientation in the Human CNS
- Discuss position in various divisions of the central nervous system (CNS) using the following pairs of direction terms: anterior/posterior; rostral/caudal; superior/inferior; dorsal/ventral; and medial/lateral.
- Demonstrate the three orthogonal planes that are used to section the CNS.

## Video: Functional Microanatomy of Neurons

- The basic classes of cells in the central nervous system (CNS)
  - **Neurons** are primary processors of neural signals
  - **Neuroglia** support the electrical and chemical functions of neurons
  - **Vascular** endothelium provide for the supply of blood to brain tissue
- The functional anatomy of neurons
- The microanatomical composition of gray matter in the CNS
- The microanatomical composition of white matter in the CNS
- Cortical pyramidal cell
- Interneuron
- Afferent neuron
- Efferent neuron
- Quiz: How does information typically flow through a neuron?
  - synapse -> dendrite -> cell body -> axon -> synapse
- Quiz: Which set of microanatomical structures are typically found in white matter?
  - vascular endothelium, axons

## Video: Non-Neural Cells of the CNS

- the basic classes of cells found in the central nervous system (CNS)
  - Neurons
  - Neuroglia cell = glia
  - Vascular endothelium
- the basic functions of the three types of glial cells found in the CNS.
- the blood-brain barrier.
- Neuroglia cell: supports chemical and electrical functions of neurons
  - supports the metabolic (=chemcial) and signaling (=electrical) functions of neurons
  - participates in neuron circuit formation and synaptic plasticity
  - makes myelin (= axonal insulation)
  - contributes to formation of blood-brain barrier
  - participates in inflammatory response in injured neural tissue, including phagocytosis of cellular debris
  - contributes to the formation of scar tissue in damaged brain and spinal cord
- Glia type 1: Astrocyte
  - is found primarily in gray matter (closely associated with neuronal cell bodies, dendrites, and synapses).
  - helps maintain ionic balance of extracellular fluids.
  - takes up and processes neurotransmitters from synaptic clefts.
  - assists in the formation of new synapses and circuits.
  - contributes to the formation of blood-brain barrier and brain-ependymal (ventricular) barrier.
  - contributes to the formation of scars in necrotic neural tissue following injury.
